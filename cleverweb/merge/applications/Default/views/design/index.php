                  <h1>CleverWeb\'s Design</h1>  
                  <p>
                  CleverWeb is specifically designed with 3 basic ideas:<br />
                  &bull; Features<br />
                  &bull; Speed<br />
                  &bull; Easy To Use<br /><br />
                  It is also designed with just one law: <strong>Quality over Quantity</strong><br /><br />
                  As far as visual design is concerned no work has been done, however we are looking forword to a "future minimalist" look.<br /><br />
                  NOTE:The current visual design is temporary, and is only in place until CleverWeb has its own.
                  <h2>The Logic Hierarchy</h2>
                  CleverWeb uses what we like to call "The Logic Hierarchy." The idea being that we use simple words and functions formed in the correct fashon to make a logical decision. Here is a ITI(idea-to-image) of CleverWeb\'s hierarchy.<br />
