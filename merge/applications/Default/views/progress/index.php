                  <h1>Details</h1>
                  <strong>Clean-Up:</strong> Code-Cleaning is a major part of the builing process, it allows for software to stay up-to-date and fast. The biggest thing is looking back trying to correct old scripts, so that they don\'t slow CleverWeb down. Several "code clean-ups" are planned as part of the building process.<br />
                  <strong>HTML5:</strong> We are starting incorperation of the latest and greatist programing language that the internet has to offer. Sadly, this will likely be in the early stages of devolpment even after CleverWeb is released, due to the fact that it is so new that HTML5 is even done being built yet.<br />
                  <strong>Minor Function Building:</strong> Function building will be a constant part of the building process of CleverWeb. This will ensure that we dont miss any good ideas for CleverWeb features.<br />
                  <strong>Minor Graphic Design:</strong> We are attempting to add on a team member so we are having him do some minor graphic design. Most of which you will not be able to see(yet).
